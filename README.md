___
### 1. Abstract
___
People sometimes find themselves unable to find anything to eat when they open their pantry or fridge. Although the ingredients are the proper way to utilize them and form a whole from parts, it can be challenging. Finding a way to utilize many different ingredients to make a dish is not everyone's forte. Rather than eating an unhealthy meal, or spending money on fast food or takeout, our app will help bridge the gap between simple ingredients, and a recipe.
### 2. Introduction
Our project is simple, it will allow users to log in and it will enable them to input ingredients they have around the house. It will then take  those ingredients and show them what recipes involve them so they have a better idea about what to cook.
